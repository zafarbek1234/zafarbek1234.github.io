<pre id="plot" >In Paris, the aristocratic and intellectual Philippe is a quadriplegic millionaire who is 
interviewing candidates for the position of his carer, with his red-haired secretary Magalie. Out 
of the blue, the rude African Driss cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the 
Social Security and asks Phillipe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position so he can 
receive his unemployment benefit. Philippe challenges Driss, offering him a trial period of one 
month to gain experience helping him. Then Driss can decide whether he would like to stay 
with him or not. Driss accepts the challenge and moves to the mansion, changing the boring 
life of Phillipe and his employees.

cannot seem to get anything right in class. When he gets into far more trouble than his 
parents can handle, he is packed off to a boarding school to 'be disciplined'
